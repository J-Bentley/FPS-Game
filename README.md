# FPS-Game

Destroy enemies to get money, buy guns at the shop, open doors to progress through the levels and survive unlimited waves of enemies.

My first game, made in Unity with only some prior knowledge of gamedev/programming. Still in early development, the alpha is nothing like what the finished version will be like.
